<h2>Problem 1:</h2>

A movie has just been released and people are queuing up to buy tickets for this movie. Suppose you are a ticket counter employee and you give a ticket to a buyer in exchange for $10. Each buyer has only one 10, 20 or 40 dollar banknote. You don't have any money in the beginning and with the money you get from each buyer, you can give the rest of the money to the other buyers in the queue.

As an input, a positive integer n representing the number of people in the queue is given in the first line. Then in the next n lines, in each line there is a number from the numbers 10, 20 or 40, which represents the value of each person's banknote. 

You must declare if it is possible to sell tickets and return the rest of the buyers' money to them with this arrangement of queues. If the answer is yes, print **YES**, otherwise print **NO**.

A test case for input and output is as below:

<h2>Problem 2:</h2>

A boy is playing on the roof of a multi-story building with a height of h. Since he is a playful child, he constantly runs here and there and plays with his ball. In one moment, his ball is released from the edge of the roof towards the ground. After each impact, the ball loses some of its energy and after each impact, its height decreases by a constant factor. We represent this coefficient with b.

For Example:

If the ball is released from a height of 50 meters and b is equal to 0.4, after the first collision, it rises to a height of 20 meters and then falls again; After the third collision, it rises to a height of 8 meters and returns to the bottom, and so on.

In one of the middle floors of the building, the boy's mother stands on the edge of a window at a height of w from the ground and watches the outside.

Calculate the number of times the ball passes in front of Asghar's mother's eyes. (Note that the mother only sees balls that are higher than the window.)

The conditions for this problem are as below:

1. The decimal number h must be greater than zero.

2. The decimal number b must be between zero and one.

3. The decimal number of w must be less than h.

If any of the above conditions were not met, the number -1, and otherwise print the number of times the ball passes in front of the mother's eyes.
